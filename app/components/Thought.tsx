          What makes me a ui ux designer

            My journey into UI/UX design was inspired by a creator I deeply admire â€” Maisy Leigh, a 
            software engineer who became a creative entrepreneur to bring her ideas to life. Her brand, 
            CozyLeigh Studios, blends warmth, aesthetics, and functionality values that resonate deeply 
            with me.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm inspired by her approach to designing cozy, meaningful spaces that make people feel at 
            home, both online and offline. Through my own work, I hope to create experiences that carry 
            the same sense of care, comfort, and purpose.
